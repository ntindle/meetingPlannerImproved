# meetingPlannerImproved
Improved meeting planner that uses tkinter to provide better User I/O

## What is needed to run my project?

First, please install python3 from [Python Official Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Make sure that in the installation, you check tcl/tk and IDLE under optional features in order to get the GUI elements under tkinter.

My program uses tkinter to control the GUI:
Tkinter is included with Python distributions since Python 3.1 release (as I mentioned above).

If for some reason, tkinter is not in your python installation, please reinstall Python and make sure that tcl/tk and IDLE is checked under the optional features during the installation.


## Running my program

After installing python and ensuring that tkinter is in your python installation, please open the command line/terminal and proceed to navigate to the folder where the project is installed.

Then, enter 'python3 calendarLogic.py'

This will run the application.

(The GUI is handled by calendarLogic.py and the logic is handled by meetingPlanner.py)

## Please let me know if there are issues

If there are any logic issues or GUI issues, please let me know!
